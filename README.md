# My First Portfolio

## Description 

As a future software engineer, I want to be able to have a representation of my work throughout this bootcamp.  With this project, I practiced my HTML and CSS capabilities while being able to show a preview and link my deployed projects.  However, this is only the start of my portfolio.  With more knowledge and additional practice, I hope to compare this initial portfolio with future ones that I will be placing on my resume.  

## Technologies

I used HTML and CSS in order to create a portfolio from scratch.  Nestles within the assests are images that represent myself as well as a preview for my projects. 

## Instalation

N/A

## Usage

This portfolio is interactive from the start.  Atop you will find a list of different links that you can click, which will bring you to that section of my portfolio.  Within the "previous work" section, there are images.  These images are interactive and will open a new web page with my deployed project.  There is also a name below these pictures, which also act as a link to the deployed projects.  Also the very bottom, there is a section for users to input their contact information if they wish to reach out to me.  Finally, if a user adjusts the viewport, the page items adjust their sizing to compensate.  

## License

This project utilized VScode as the code editor.  

## Additional Resources

A link for the deployed webpage.
