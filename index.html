          <p> Hello there! My name is Alejandro Le Mendez or Alex Le for short.</p>

        <div class= "about-me-content">
          <p> I am currently working on becoming a full-stack developer through a program provided by UC Berkley. I have always had an interest in programming since high school, where I was able to help create a robotics club. This was my small introduction to the expansive world of coding languages and the ever-expanding functionality of it. However, I was never able to expand on the small amount of exposure I experienced. Learning to code is a daunting task and I found myself confused as to where to start and ultimately was deterred altogether. It wasn't until recently, when I decided to attempt the creation of an application that was geared towards helping decompress Emergency Room lobbies, that I rekindled my interest in the development world. Attempting to create an interactive app with a comprehensive UI was well over my head and demonstrated just how little knowledge I had. With that being said all of the projects listed here are a representation of my overall growth. From starting from very little knowledge to hopefully becoming an experienced full-stack developer capable of working diligently in the field. </p>

              I created this project in order to access notes regarding some of the fundamentals for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It's created in an easy to digest format that contains multiple easy to perform tips. There are also some general reminders that will be easy to review if a client becomes stuck in the future. With this project I learned that debugging can be easier to perform when there are less mistakes within the code due to not knowing the basics. It inspired me to keep trying to perfect the syntax of things and improve my abilities inputing them.

             As software engineers and those who code, we should practice avoiding unnecessary code within our work. With this project, I decreased the amount of repetitive and unnecessary code while still maintaining the functionality from an already existing website. I did this, not only to optimize the website to the best of my ability, but also to practice HTML and CSS integration. This project taught me the benefits of grouping class systems that will be affected similarily within a website. I hope this project inspires others to continue adjusting their code to maximize the efficiency of their work.

            <p>
             This project used two API resources in order to motivate League of Legend players. There is a common phrase to "touch grass" that is used in the gaming world in order to motivate the player base to take a break and go outside. For this project, my group and I wanted to use this phrase as a hyperbole. This application shows the rank status of any individual player based on their region's server and produces a motivational GIF with it. These GIFs range from dissapointment, if you have no rank; to joyous congratulations for higher ranks. This project was also used as a source of collaboration between other students within the same bootcamp cohort and is an application for us to show all that we have learned so far in front end development. We were able to utilize two APIs from completely different sources and use them together to make our project. It inspired us to keep striving forward with new and innovative ideas. Ultimately, it showed us that the sky is really the limit within programming and if you can think of it, then can create it.
