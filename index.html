          <p> Hello there! My name is Alejandro Le Mendez or Alex Le for short.</p>

        <div class= "about-me-content">
          <p> I am currently working on becoming a full-stack developer through a program provided by UC Berkley. I have always had an interest in programming since high school, where I was able to help create a robotics club. This was my small introduction to the expansive world of coding languages and the ever-expanding functionality of it. However, I was never able to expand on the small amount of exposure I experienced. Learning to code is a daunting task and I found myself confused as to where to start and ultimately was deterred altogether. It wasn't until recently, when I decided to attempt the creation of an application that was geared towards helping decompress Emergency Room lobbies, that I rekindled my interest in the development world. Attempting to create an interactive app with a comprehensive UI was well over my head and demonstrated just how little knowledge I had. With that being said all of the projects listed here are a representation of my overall growth. From starting from very little knowledge to hopefully becoming an experienced full-stack developer capable of working diligently in the field. </p>
