          <p>I am currently working on becoming a full-stack developer through a program provided by UC Berkley. I have always had an interest in programming since high school, where I was able to help create a robotics club. This was my small introduction to the expansive world of coding languages and the ever expanding functionality of it. Originally I wanted to go into the medical field as a physician </p>
